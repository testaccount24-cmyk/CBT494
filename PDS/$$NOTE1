     The exit works by "sensing" when a user log is present. If
one is not present, it simply uses SYS1.BRODCAST. As you can see
the code to do this is amazingly trivial. I wrote this many years
ago and must have been inspired by some piece of IBM
documentation. When I went back later (while installing a later
release) to see if the exit was still valid, I could not find
justification for the technique in the manuals. I tried it (on
releases up to OS/390 1.2) and it has continued to work.
